    - term: Generative AI (Gen AI)
      desc: A branch of artificial intelligence focusing on creating new, original content by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily analyzes or classifies information, generative AI can produce novel outputs such as text, images, music, code, and even video. It works by training on large datasets to understand the structure and relationships within the data, then uses that understanding to generate content that is coherent and often creative. Applications of generative AI ranges from chatbots and virtual assistants to image synthesis, content creation, drug discovery, and design.
