        produce novel outputs such as text, images, music, code, and even video.
        It works by training on large datasets to understand the structure and
        relationships within the data, then uses that understanding to generate
        content that is coherent and often creative. Applications of generative
        AI ranges from chatbots and virtual assistants to image synthesis,
        content creation, drug discovery, and design.

            example of a structured dataset could be tabular data stored in a
            rigid format such as a table, relational database, spreadsheet, CSV,
            or a dataframe. In Mathematics, an example of a structured dataset
            could be a set of data points that follow a consistent arrangement,
            allowing them to be treated as matrix-like objects. In Statistics,
            an example of a structured dataset could be a table where each row
            is a patient and columns include blood pressure, age, and treatment
            group.

        - term: Unstructured Dataset
          desc: An unstructured dataset is a collection of data that doesn’t follow a fixed row-and-column format. The information may be text, images, audio, video, or logs. It often requires preprocessing, parsing, or feature extraction to make it usable in analysis or computation. In Coding, examples of a unstructured datasets would be text documents, emails, social media posts, images, audio/video files, or JSON files without a strict schema. In Mathematics, examples of a unstructured datasets would be a set of elements without a clear, uniform arrangement requiring transformation before mathematical operations can be applied. In Statistics, examples of unstructured datasets would be data that cannot be directly used in standard statistical tables or models, e.g. images, audio, video, or text such as written customer reviews that require sentiment scores.
