It often requires preprocessing, parsing, or feature extraction to make it usable in analysis or computation. In Coding, examples of a unstructured datasets would be text documents, emails, social media posts, images, audio/video files, or JSON files without a strict schema. In Mathematics, examples of a unstructured datasets would be a set of elements without a clear, uniform arrangement requiring transformation before mathematical operations can be applied. In Statistics, examples of unstructured datasets would be data that cannot be directly used in standard statistical tables or models, e.g. images, audio, video, or text such as written customer reviews that require sentiment scores.",
